**HBmonitor is a "web dashboard" for HBlink by N0MJS.**

***This is version of HBMonitor V2 by SP2ONG 2019-2021***

The main difference between HBMonitor v1 and v2 is the layout, i.e. the main page shows condensed 
information and on the subpages, you can see the individual content that was shown on v1

I recommend not running HBmonitor on the same computer as HBlink3

HBmonitor tested on Debian v9 and v10

This is version HBMonitor V2 

    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/sp2ong/HBMonv2.git
    cd HBMonv2
    git checkout webserver-python
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    cp config-SAMPLE.py config.py
    edit config.py and change what you necessary
    cp utils/hbmon.service /lib/systemd/system/
    systemctl enable hbmon
    systemctl start hbmon
    systemctl status hbmon
    forward TCP ports 8080 and 9000 in firewall
    
    Please setup your SYSTEM INFO subpage with the following instruction:
    
    https://github.com/sp2ong/HBMonv2/tree/main/sysinfo
    
    If you use openbrige links, in config.py in OPB_FILTER enter NETWORK_ID to do not display
    unnecessary entries in LASTHEARD.
    
    Please remember the table lastheard displays only station transmissions that are longer than 2 seconds.
    
    If you don't want to have the lastheard list set in config.py:  
      LASTHEARD_INC = False
    
    If you want to have more than the last 15 entries in the Lastherad table
    change in the monitor.py file line from
      if n == 15:
    to for example:
      if n == 20:

    I recommend using the following settings:
        WEB_AUTH = True
      in config.py and set a proper username and password in:
        WEB_USER = 'hblink'
        WEB_PASS = 'hblink'
    will provide access to more information about masters / peers / openbridge / monitor for users 
    who know access Information.

    The display of buttons configurations are in the directory templates/buttons.html file. Don't change 
    the code in the first part that checks if you have WEB_AUTH settings in config.py
    If you want to add your own buttons put the code below the line
    <! --- Own buttons html code ->
    
    The logo image you can replace with file image: img/logo.png
    
    In config.py you can choose one of the predefined HBmonitor colors or define your own by entering the code in THEME_COLOR
    
    In directory sysinfo/ you can find info on how to setup display SYSTEM Info data in Monitor. 

    If not need monitor online rules (I do not recommend please use in config.py BRIDGES_INC = False
